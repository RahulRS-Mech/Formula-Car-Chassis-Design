# Formula-Car-Chassis-Design üèéÔ∏è
As an undergraduate, I contributed to the **Formula Student team**, assisting in **chassis design, material selection, and fabrication** of a race car. My role involved **supporting the design and manufacturing process**, ensuring the frame was **lightweight yet structurally rigid**. This project provided **hands-on experience in automotive engineering**, from **CAD modeling** to **machining and welding**.  


## üõ† **Tools & Technologies Used**
### **Software**
- **SolidWorks, CATIA V5** ‚Äì Chassis and suspension modeling.  
- **ANSYS (FEA)** ‚Äì Structural analysis for weight optimization.  

### **Hardware**
- **CNC Machines & Lathe** ‚Äì Precision machining of components.  
- **TIG Welding Equipment** ‚Äì Frame assembly and structural reinforcement.  


##  **Methodology**
- **Chassis Design:**  
  - Assisted in **modeling a tubular space frame** using **SolidWorks**, optimizing for **strength-to-weight ratio**.  
- **Material Selection:**  
  - Supported the **selection of chromoly steel** for **high strength and weldability**.  
  - Assisted in **choosing aluminum alloys** for **lightweight suspension components**.  
- **Fabrication Support:**  
  - Helped with **CNC machining and lathe operations** for precision-cut parts.  
  - Assisted in **TIG welding and assembly of the frame**.  


##  **Key Takeaways**
- ‚úÖ Gained **hands-on experience** in **automotive design and fabrication**.  
- ‚úÖ Developed **basic machining and welding skills** in **race car manufacturing**.  
- ‚úÖ Learned about **weight distribution, material selection, and chassis optimization** in high-performance vehicle design.
